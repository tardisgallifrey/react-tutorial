<h1>The ReactJS Tutorial They Missed<h1>

<h2>A ReactJS project built with Snowpack that follows most of the Reactjs.org lessons<h2>
<hr>
<p>I had real problems trying to learn ReactJS because the main React.org website didn't seem to explain 
anything about how to formulate JSX Component files into an App. Fortunately, I've been able to figure that out 
somewhat and the result is the tutorial I am currently working on.</p>

<p>This project builds from the Microsoft Learn lessons on ReactJS, which uses Snowpack bundler.  If you wish, you 
should try going through some of those lessons (there are only three) before embarking here.</p>

<p>Most of what I've learned, I am trying to write in as comments in the JSX files.</p>

<p>I'll include more helps on application structure here as well, time permitting.</p>
